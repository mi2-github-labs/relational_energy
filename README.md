Ever been to a great meeting ... wanted to quantify that?

This is a super simple browser based tool to measure the relational energy of a meeting.

Built with p5js :)

Demo at: https://relationalenergy.parseapp.com/

If running on localhost, needs to run as server using something like node http-server (https://github.com/processing/p5.js/wiki/Local-server)

Must allow browser to use mic.
